      - role: Senior Software Engineer
        time: 2021/07 - 2023/07
        company: Shopee, Beijing
        details: |
          I joined Shopee as senior software engineer in 2021 in Network team. I was responsible for maintaining
          HA proxy and Nginx in Shopee's production environment. I've learned a lot of knowledge about network and

          responsible for maintaining Shopee's deploy platform which is the core platform for all Shopee's services.
          I've developed a lot of features for deploy platform and improved the stability of deploy platform. I've learned
          massive knowledge about cloud native and distributed system during my work in Shopee. In the meantime, I've also
          design and developed brand new deploy platform for Shopee's which is based on Kubernetes and Openkruise. The new platform
          is more stable, more efficient and more flexible than the old one and aims to replace the old one in the future.
          In Shopee, I've improved my skills in
          - Golang
          - Kubernetes
          - Openkruise
          - Distributed System

        company: Hortor Games, beijing
        details: |
          Hortor Games is a mobile game company that develops and publishes lots of popular mobile games in China.
          I joined Hortor Games as an intern in 2017, last year of my college. I was assigned to infrastructure team which  provides
          infrastructure support for all game teams. I was responsible for maintaining and developing some internal tools for infrastructure 
          team at first. After that, I was responsible building and maintaining new game platform to replace the old one and it should be have 
          better performance and stability. I spent a year to build the new game platform and it was successfully launched. I've used a lot of
          technologies in the new game platform, including
          - Microservices
          - New Databases
          - MQ
          - ETCD
          - Redis
          - Kubernetes

          I should mention that this new game platform has provided a lot of online services for all game teams that means the platform has
          a lot of traffic and it should be stable and efficient. At the maximum, the platform has handled 100k QPS and 10k concurrent connections.
          In the other hand, the platform had 10 Million DAU, 100 Million MAU and 1 Million orders per day. So, it takes a lot of effort to make
          the platform stable and efficient and it still works well till now.

          I'm so proud and grateful that I've joined Hortor Games at my first job and enlisted in such a great project.
