        link: "https://go-goim.github.io"
        tagline: |
          GoIM is a distributed instant messaging solution based on `Golang` and `RocketMQ`. It's a high performance and high availability solution.
          I've developed GoIM in 2021 and it's still under development. It has passed the basic IM tests, but it still needs a lot of work to be done.
          My main purpose of developing GoIM is to learn distributed system and Instant Messaging. I've occurred a lot of problems during the development of GoIM
          and I've fixed most of them. It means I've learned something and improved my skills.
